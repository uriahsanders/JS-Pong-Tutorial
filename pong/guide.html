        	Learning JS through Pong
        </q>
        <br>
        In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamentals of javascript, all while creating your first game. Lets skip the "Hello World"
        and get right to game development! This tutorial is broken up into 5 parts, and by the end you will have created your first game. (They're short, easy and fun, I promise!).
        <br><br>
        	<a href="p0.html">Part 0</a>: General info and getting started.<br>
        	<a href="p1.html">Part 1</a>: Pseudo code, and how computers think<br>
	        <a href="p2.html">Part 2</a>: Saving the player's age from birth year, and setting an age limit.<br>
	        <a href="p3.html">Part 3</a>: Start and end screens, beginning the game, drawing ball and paddle.<br>
	        <a href="p4.html">Part 4</a>: Finding the highest score, animation, collision testing, game logic.<br>
	        <a href="p5.html">Part 5</a>: Finishing game, resources and discussion.<br>

        This tutorial is an introductory course to programming, designed to be easy and fun, by alleviating the fear of technical stuff and having people learn through a project that's actually fun. Throughout the development of our game, we will learn lots of things about programming; but to keep the course simple, I'll also be leaving a lot of technical stuff out. I even leave out some basic stuff.
        <br><br>
        My goal isn't to teach all the in's and out's of programming. I just want to give a comfortable introduction that actually matters. It is up to the reader to do neccesary research, trial, and error. I want people to follow this tutorial and be comfortable with continuing in their journey, not neccesarily be fully skilled. Additional resources will be given at the end of the tutorial to help with that.
