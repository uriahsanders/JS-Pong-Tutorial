<!-- 
	And that's it. That's how you make pong in JS. The concepts are actually pretty simple,
	and just build on stuff you already understand. Try playing aroud with some values to see what happens.
	You could try fixing some bugs, adding a paddle to the top as well, adding more balls,
	making the player be able to get certain powers, etc.
	This isn't neccesarily the best way to do it, or how I would do it, but I just kept it simple :)
	Have fun!
