        <br>
        By the end of this part, you should be set up and ready for coding. You will understand how to learn programming, why learning it is useful, and what javascript is. You will also be introduced to our "Pong" project.

        <q>Our Project</q><br>
        	 So, as you've seen in the example, you will be creating Pong, a game where you keep the ball from hitting the ground with a moving paddle. I chose this game because it's one of the simplest games you could possibly make. It's also easy to improve and make unique. To make sure that you get a bigger taste of what programming has to offer, we will also be asking the user's birthyear, calculating their age, and using that to either allow them to or prevent them from playing the game.<br><br>
        	 If Pong sounds boring to you, suck it up. After this you will be able to easily understand how much more fun and complicated games can be created.

        <q>Setting up </q><br>
        	People write programs in an IDE (integrated development environment), or a text editor. Basically, you type in your programs with a bunch of nice features that make programming easier. A simple google search will show you that there are plenty out there. Personally, I use sublime text 2.<br><br>
        	After you've downloaded an IDE, starting your first javascript project is super easy! Just create a file that ends in ".html", and open it up with your favorite web browser(which hopefully isn't internet explorer). Type stuff into the file with your IDE/text editor, save, and refresh. You'll see the changes!<br><br> 
            However, the ".html" file extension is for web pages. What you write inside of it is not read by your computer as code. To do that, you'll need to write "&lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt;" inside of your file. Between those two "tags" is where you will be writing javascript. When your computer sees the script tags, it will know that everything inside of them is special. 
            <br><br>
            Please don't worry to much about why you need to do that. More information about how all of this work will be given at the end of the tutorial. Right now, we're going to focus on actual programming.

        <q>What is Javascript?</q><br>
        	I'll save you plenty of google searches and let you know right now: there is no best programming language. You choose the tool that's right for the job. This tutorial will be teaching JS, because it's common, easy to get started with, and runs EVERYWHERE. You can make websites, games, apps...all cross platform, cross OS, cross browser, cross everything. Also, it has countless tutorials and information dedicated to it, is a rising language, and it's easy to find people who work with it.

        <q>How to Learn Programming </q><br>
        	This tutorial is a good start. But, after this, there will still be plenty to learn. As a matter of fact, you'll also probably have to keep revisiting what you learned here to really understand it.<br><br> That's okay. The reason I wrote this tutorial was to have people learn the real way, through a project that's actually interesting. After this one you can start your own. You don't have to try to memorize anything. That's boring. Just keep researching what you don't know as you go, and eventually you'll learn through repetition. Google, google, google. Let it become your best friend.

       <q>Why Learn Programming</q> <br>
        	There are many reasons to learn programming. You love creating new things, you like to understand how things work, you like having power over your tools, or maybe there's something specific that you want to do.<br><br>
        	Programming is a tool to solve problems. And in a great many cases it's the right tool. Any problem that can be solved in a step by step way can be made more efficient with a program. Stick some hardware behind it, and you can even automate physical processes.
